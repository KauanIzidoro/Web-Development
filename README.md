## Topics Covered This Semester:
1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;
2. Building Pages with HTML;
3. Prototyping Pages;
4. DOM Manipulation.

## Highlights
- Initially, we covered the basic syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with creating simple static web pages.
- Throughout the course, we practiced building web pages using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. We also explored responsive design techniques to ensure web pages look good on various devices.
- The final projects focused on advanced topics such as DOM Manipulation, AJAX for asynchronous web requests, and the implementation of modern web development frameworks and libraries.


## 1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage by using a variety of elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other multimedia content. Each element is represented by tags, which help the browser understand and render the content appropriately.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style and layout web pages. It allows developers to apply styles to HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS makes it possible to create visually appealing websites and ensures that they are responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a powerful programming language that enables dynamic interaction on web pages. It can be used to manipulate the HTML and CSS, respond to user events, validate forms, create animations, and much more. JavaScript is essential for adding interactivity and enhancing user experience on websites.

## 2. Building Pages with HTML
Building web pages with HTML involves structuring the content using various HTML elements. The process includes defining the page layout with elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`, and embedding multimedia content with `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>`. Additionally, links (`<a>`) and forms (`<form>`) are used for navigation and user input, respectively.

## 3. Prototyping Pages
Prototyping involves creating a preliminary version of a webpage to visualize its layout and functionality before full-scale development. This process helps in identifying potential issues and gathering feedback. Tools like wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes are used. Wireframes are basic, low-fidelity sketches of the page structure, while mockups are more detailed, high-fidelity visual representations. Interactive prototypes simulate user interactions and can be created using tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.

## 4. DOM Manipulation
DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation refers to the process of dynamically changing the content, structure, and style of a webpage using JavaScript. The DOM represents the HTML document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to a part of the document. JavaScript provides methods to select, add, modify, and delete these nodes, enabling developers to update the webpage content and layout in response to user interactions or other events.
